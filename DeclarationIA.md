**Declaration of AI Use**

- Did you use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)?
  Yes, we used AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude during the development of this project.

- For what tasks?
  We used AI tools mainly for:
  - Helping with initial code structure
  - Assisting with some code generation
  - Clarifying implementation details
  - Supporting early transformations and debugging

- Which parts of the work are fully yours?
  We were responsible for:
  - Designing and structuring the neural network architecture
  - Selecting and configuring the hyperparameters
  - Implementing the final training process
  - Running experiments and comparing different configurations
  - Choosing the final model
  - Evaluating performance and generating the final predictions

- External Resources Used
  We consulted the following academic material to better understand multilayer perceptrons and transformations:
